## ITDD with DialogueAct

### Usage

The model has two mode. The one mode predicts normally, the other mode do with act label.

### Abstract

Document Grounded Conversations is a task to generate dialogue responses when chatting about the content of a given document. Obviously, document knowledge plays a critical role in Document Grounded Conversations, while existing dialogue models do not exploit this kind of knowledge effectively enough. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based architecture for multi-turn document grounded conversations. In particular, we devise an Incremental Transformer to encode multi-turn utterances along with knowledge in related documents. Motivated by the human cognitive process, we design a two-pass decoder (Deliberation Decoder) to improve context coherence and knowledge correctness. Our empirical study on a real-world Document Grounded Dataset proves that responses generated by our model significantly outperform competitive baselines on both context coherence and knowledge relevance.



### Dataset

We use the dataset proposed in [A Dataset for Document Grounded Conversations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07358.pdf). As there is a little overlap between training set and testing set in the original dataset, we remove the duplicates and format the data for our model. Please download the processed data [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16AcawDtG4HqUlQHV_zb4tZD4KNCAx_Vf/view?usp=sharing).
